# TattsGen
If you look at the archive of lottery draws, you can see some patterns, for example, the numbers never follow each other (1,2,3,4,5,6) or the numbers that fall out are not all even. Based on these and other factors, I make a program that allows you to generate the most likely options.
Generation of combinations for playing TattsLotto
The program was created in the NetBeans 8.2 IDE using the Oracle JDK 1.8.0_111.
To generate combinations, the program needs an archive of previous draws in CSV format, it is attached as a file LottoArchive.csv
